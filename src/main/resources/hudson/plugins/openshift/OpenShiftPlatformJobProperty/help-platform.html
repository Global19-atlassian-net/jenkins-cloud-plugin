	<p><b>Important:</b> This setting only applies if you set the job <i>Label Expression</i> to match the <i>Project name</i> of your job.</p>
	<p>
	Setting the job label is done automatically for you by the OpenShift client tools, but if you are manually setting
	up a job, you need to set this.  You can set the <i>Label Expression</i> by checking <i>Restrict where this project can be run</i>
	and then copying your <i>Project Name</i> into the text field.  The label is used to lookup the job details, including 
	the <i>Builder Type</i>, <i>Application UUID</i> and <i>Builder Size</i> when your slave builders are created.

	This property specifies the platform your application is running on.
